{"name":"startr","tagline":"A simple personal homepage ","body":"startr\r\n======\r\n\r\nA simple personal homepage where you can manage your daily tasks &amp; notes 100% privately...\r\n\r\nAll the magic happens inside your browser, so all you will add here it's for your eyes only! \r\n\r\n> I open-sourced the project because this way anyone can see that **NO** information is sent elsewhere than on your local machine (localStorage). So no, no one's spying on you! you're safe!\r\n\r\n\r\n###Demo\r\n\r\nhttp://cookies.0010media.com/startr/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Install\r\n\r\nJust clone the project, add the startr.html file somewhere on your disk or on a server and you're ready to go. \r\n\r\nSet it as your start page and enjoy it :)\r\n\r\n\r\n###Usage\r\n\r\n#####NOTEPAD : \r\n\r\nThe notepad text is automatically saved when the textbox loses its focus.\r\n\r\n#####TASKS : \r\nA task contains : task name + tags + the project \r\n\r\n######Tags\r\nThe tags are defined as hashtags : `#my_tag` `#startr`\r\n\r\n> Please note that there are several tags that have by default different colors : #idea + #bug - you can always add others from the code :)\r\n\r\nYou can easily display all the tasks associated to a tag by clicking on a tag name.\r\n\r\n\r\n######The Project Name\r\nTasks can be grouped in projects. To add a project, just add the `@` symbol followed by the project name in the task name.\r\n\r\n\r\n######Examples\r\n\r\nThe order of the tags and the project is not important : \r\n\r\n`@startr Modify the README file #todo`  \r\n\r\nis the same as   \r\n\r\n`Modify the README file #todo @startr`  \r\n\r\nand as  \r\n\r\n`#todo Modify the README file @startr`  \r\n\r\n\r\n###Features\r\n\r\n1. **Todo List** \r\n2. **Notepad** \r\n3. **Import / Export** \r\n\r\n#### Other ideas\r\n\r\n>  some of them will be implemented.... or all :) - who knows !\r\n\r\n1. Weather\r\n2. Google Calendar Agenda (display the events)\r\n3. Links (open your favorite links quicker - have a favicon list or text based list)\r\n4. Make `startr` available as a browser addon\r\n5. Add the date to the finished tasks (this way you can have an idea when a task was done)\r\n6. Allow the user to set a date to a task (will be eventually indicated in the interface by a small calendar icon displayed in front of the task's checkbox)\r\n7. Make the finished taks list smaller and scrollable (when you have a lot of finished tasks, the list becames ugly - grey and ugly). Or hide it by default and have a link (finished tasks) that will display the list. Anyway, the current display of the finished tasks list must be changed\r\n8. ...\r\n \r\n\r\n#### Author(s) :\r\n- Cristian CIOFU - www.iamchris.info\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Credits :\r\n- jQuery ==> http://jquery.com/\r\n- modernizr ==> http://modernizr.com/\r\n- normalize.css ==> http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/\r\n- savefile ==> http://savefile.joshmcarthur.com/\r\n","google":"UA-53849-38","note":"Don't delete this file!
